Goal for today

convert drawings to entities
	the real hard part here is determining validity
		full loop
		intersecting sides
			not too bad
		nested drawings
			I have no idea how
			maybe check all the curves to see which are connected?
				maybe I should refine my curves to have the previous and next curve
					It would fix the problem of disconnected endings
				for each curve group, check which side of the side each vertex is on
					if they are all the same you know which side is which?
						does it work for concave polygons?
		over/under size
