Goals
	
change draftform from being in screen coordinates to world coordinates
	lighting affects rendering so another rendercontext has to be used
	I could make the a new rendercontext and have it update when the activity updates
		This is the best solution

I need to make some fancy callbacks for various happenings
	window resizing
	window closing
	element created / possibly added to level
	collisions
	GUI stuff???

convert drawings to entities
	the real hard part here is determining validity
		full loop
		intersecting sides
			not too bad
		nested drawings
			I have no idea how
			maybe check all the curves to see which are connected?
				maybe I should refine my curves to have the previous and next curve
					It would fix the problem of disconnected endings
				for each curve group, check which side of the side each vertex is on
					if they are all the same you know which side is which?
						does it work for concave polygons?
		over/under size
		
Create new model
	direct buffers
	possible interleaving
	subupdates
	skeletons/rigging
	bindless/multi textures???
	
redesign model generator
	reusability of buffers?
	buffer pool?
	face trianglulation also has decomposition
	
Add way to select objects and move stuff around and shit
	I have to change more of the physics interface
	Needs a way to show/highlight selected objects
		
Add layers
	Add user data to physics engine
	Add player movement between layers
		Create animation callback thingy?
			Animations would be functions of time
			Input delta time -> get value between 0 and 1
			Use value to update some animation
	Control skeletons for animating thickness and layer
