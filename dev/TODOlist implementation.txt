Goal for today

update render context
	add uninstanceable groups to render context
convert drawings to entities
	the real hard part here is determining validity
		full loop
		intersecting sides
			not too bad
		nested drawings
			I have no idea how
			maybe check all the curves to see which are connected?
				maybe I should refine my curves to have the previous and next curve
					It would fix the problem of disconnected endings
				for each curve group, check which side of the side each vertex is on
					if they are all the same you know which side is which?
						does it work for concave polygons?
		over/under size
		
fix camera so that it follows the character
	requires keeping track of camera settings and rebuilding the mat4 when resizing window
	I am thinking having camera object that store the variables.
		Camera interface has the following methods
			getMatrix();
			setViewport(Dimension size) //name still in progress
		the separate implementations (ortho and perspective) have their own variables such as near and far z axis, field of view, position, etc.
