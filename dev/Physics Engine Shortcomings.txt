I need to redefine the physics engine interface

::current problems::
no snapshots
	I don't think this is fixable without modifying the source
	research later
no multithreading
	This definitey has to be implemented at the source
	investigate later when overhauling engine
	nvidia has a great article on parallel tree creation
settings need to be implemented as a tree
	ezpz. I just need to make an interface for the various engines
	do later because it's not important
no way to set multiple fixtures to body definition
	major problem that can be fixed by the architecture overhaul
	separate fixtures from objects
	semi-solved
		waiting on shapes
no user data
	super easy
no way to set shape types
	need to create a shape object
	should I have one shape interface and a bunch of subclasses?
	should I have one monolithic object?
	monolithic is probably better since I can't force updates for the engine anyway
not properly set up for trans-engine use
	this is a tricky one
	I would have to implement it similarly to my render engine
	it is similar to creating a user
remove array use for Vec2 or Vec3
