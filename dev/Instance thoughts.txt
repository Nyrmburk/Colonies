I think that an Entity should have an InstanceAttribute. It would mean that position is no longer jankily held together by seemingly magic. It would also make instancing a lot easier. The downside is that an InstanceAttribute requires a model. It is not so much a downside as it is just a little confusing. I guess if I fully adopt the idea it makes a certain amount of sense. A model should include an animation, so that is taken care of. Model will also take care of the LoD. I say let's do it.
