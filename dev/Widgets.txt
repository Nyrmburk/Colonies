behavior
	widgets come in different formats for different purposes. Some have no input and only serve to provide the initial data. Others merely transform the inputs. Some reduce multiple inputs into a single output. At the end, there are the widgets that use their inputs to directly manipulate the world.
	In order to do anything, widgets must have their inputs and outputs connected and propogate their outputs forward. It is almost like an ann. This is basically a depth first graph traversal.
	One thing I have to identify is the mechanism for linking widgets together. Is it by object? Is it by index? Who knows?
	Another thing I have to define is what the range of the outputs is going to be. I could make everything normalized between 0 and 1. I could have it be any range and the widget has to define what it does for an unlimited range of values.
