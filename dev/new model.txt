new model
ModelBuffer?

has single bytebuffer
models are allocated space
getting the individual model buffers is provided by getting a flipped slice of the requested buffer
a model could be interleaved or appened
	I'm not sure if it should be a property of the sub-models or global or what
	it will probably become more clear once I define how putting data works
setting data is done by filling the requested buffer
	I can have interleaved buffers that get/set data at a stride
	according to the lwjgl source, it gets the direct address.
		this means that interleaved data has to be uploaded in a single swoop
elegant.

forgetting interleaving, the use of fdsahkfjdhsa is as follows

have model
model has main buffer
when creating model, request number of elements and number of indices and what buffers to include
create buffer to fit
main buffer is wrapped with logic to determine updates made to buffer
buffer changes can be queried
when getting the individual buffers, a view is returned of the respective buffers
