Making the Level Editor UI

Goals
	Easy to understand and use
	fast (nobody likes clicking through dozens of menus)
	simple
	accesible (controllers, keyboards, mice, and touchscreens need to be able to use)
	
Ideas
	Side panel with a grid of elements
		pros: simple, lots of data can be shown, intuitive for all input types
		cons: idk
	Palette; A side panel with frequently used materials and objects
		pros: makes digging through menus less frequently
		cons: manual interaction and my confuse some players
	Styles; Setting styles up for certain elements so that one change affects them all
		pros: hardcore creators will love this because you can change entire atmospheres with one button
		cons: a more advanced concept; It will be underutilized by the majority of the population
		comment: this functionality could be passive with the inclusion of changing the material of all selected objects
	Some way of informing the creator that the level is getting too complicated
	
	The side panel should automatically change based on context
